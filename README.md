# PlacesApp

The Places app developed using React Native is a mobile application designed to help users discover, organize, and remember their favorite locations. Built with the React Native framework, the app offers a cross-platform solution, allowing it to run on both iOS and Android devices while sharing a significant portion of the codebase.

With the Places app, users can perform various actions related to managing and exploring places, such as:

1. Adding Places: Users can add new places to the app by providing a title, capturing an image, and locating it on a map. This feature enables users to personalize their collection of favorite locations.

2. Viewing All Places: The app provides a screen where users can view all their saved places. It displays a list with the titles and thumbnails of each place, allowing users to quickly browse and access their favorite spots.

3. Place Details: When users select a specific place from the list, the app presents a detailed view with comprehensive information about that place. This includes the title, description, location, images, and any additional details or functionalities related to that particular place.

4. Map Integration: The Places app incorporates the Google Maps API to provide an interactive and visually appealing map interface. Users can view their saved places on the map and search for nearby locations.
